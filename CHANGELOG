# 3.1.0

I forgot to convert the 3.0.0 TSV to JSON. Sorry! If you were using the TSV
data, this update is transparent to you. If you were using JSON, you will
finally get the 3.0.0 changes.

# 3.0.0

Whitespace removed from all `readings` fields.

Furthermore, corrected numerous `readings` errors caused by automatic
roumaji-to-hiragana conversion. Mainly these are ず->づ, う->お (i.e.,
とうり->とおり), お->を, etc.
